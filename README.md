# MovieRental-by-Python
A Movie Rental Software developed using Python is a system designed to manage the renting and returning of movies in a digital or physical rental store. 

Summary
This program is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

Model (domain): Represents DVD and borrowing data.

Repository (data access layer): Manages persistence (reading/writing to files).

Controller (business logic): Manages interactions between UI and data.

UI (view): Interacts with the user.


I'll help you analyze the codebase of this movie rental system. Let me examine the contents of each directory and file to provide a comprehensive explanation.
First, let me look at the main structure and key files:

Finally, let me check the UI layer:
Based on my analysis, this is a well-structured movie rental system implemented in Python following a layered architecture. Let me break down each component:
Architecture Overview:
The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
Domain Layer: Core business entities and validation
Repository Layer: Data persistence
Controller Layer: Business logic
UI Layer: User interface
Domain Layer (domain/):
Core business entities:
Dvd.py: Represents a DVD with properties like title, genre, etc.
Borrow.py: Represents a borrowing transaction
Rental.py: Represents a rental record
Validators:
DvdValidator.py, BorrowValidator.py, RentalValidator.py: Ensure data integrity
Errors.py: Custom exception handling
Repository Layer (repository/):
Handles data persistence using text files:
DvdRepository.py: Manages DVD data
BorrowRepository.py: Manages borrowing records
RentalRepository.py: Manages rental records
Implements CRUD operations for each entity
Controller Layer (controller/):
Controller.py: Orchestrates the business logic
Acts as a mediator between UI and repositories
Implements core business operations like:
Adding/removing DVDs
Processing borrows and returns
Managing rentals
UI Layer (ui/):
UI.py: Provides the user interface
Implements a console-based menu system
Handles user input and displays results
Main Application (main.py):
Entry point of the application
Initializes repositories, controller, and UI
Sets up the dependency injection
Data Storage:
Uses simple text files for persistence:
dvd.txt: Stores DVD information
borrow.txt: Stores borrowing records
The system follows good software engineering practices:
Clear separation of concerns
Proper error handling
Data validation
Modular design
Text-based persistence
The application flow:
User interacts with the UI
UI passes requests to the Controller
Controller validates and processes requests
Repository layer handles data persistence
Results flow back through the same layers
This is a well-designed system that could be extended with features like:
Database integration
Web interface
User authentication
Advanced search and filtering
Reporting and analytics
